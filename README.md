ezBookkeeping is a lightweight, self-hosted personal finance app with a user-friendly interface and powerful bookkeeping features. It's easy to deploy, and you can start it with just one single Docker command. Designed to be resource-efficient and highly scalable, it can run smoothly on devices as small as a Raspberry Pi, or scale up to NAS, MicroServers, and even large cluster environments.

ezBookkeeping offers tailored interfaces for both mobile and desktop devices. With support for PWA (Progressive Web Apps), you can even add it to your mobile home screen and use it like a native app.
